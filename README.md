# Sales Case Study — Retail Product Performance Analysis
This project analyzes a simulated retail sales dataset representing daily performance of a single product in a large retail store.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to process, analyze, and visualize sales and profitability trends. Metrics such as price per unit, gross profit, gross profit %.
The dataset includes:
-Date – Day of sales
-Sales – Total Rand value of sales
-Cost Of Sales – Total Rand cost for the product
-Quantity Sold – Units sold per day

# Project Objectives
This project aims to:
- Clean and process the raw dataset into an analytics-ready format.
- Create core sales and profitability metrics.
- Analyze product performance during promotional periods.
- Calculate Price Elasticity of Demand for promotional windows.
- Identify patterns and trends using data visualization.
 -Build a Power BI dashboard to present insights.
- Produce a GitHub‑ready project with documentation.

# Key Metrics Developed
1. Daily Sales Price per Unit
Unit Price = Sales / Quantity Sold

2. Average Unit Price
Overall average price for the product.

3. Daily % Gross Profit
GP% = (Sales - Cost of Sales) / Sales * 100

4. Daily Gross Profit per Unit
Gross Profit per Unit = (Sales - Cost of Sales) / Quantity Sold


# Summary of Insights
 Price is strongly linked to demand
During promotional periods, unit price dropped and quantity increased, indicating elastic demand.
- Product performs better under promotions
    Promotional pricing boosted daily sales volume and revenue.

- Profitability fluctuates with price changes
    Even though units increased during discounts, gross profit per unit declined — a typical trade‑off.

- Clear seasonality and trend patterns
    Sales showed visible variation across months, likely driven by promotions and store traffic patterns.
